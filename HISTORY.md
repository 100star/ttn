## 2.0.0 (2016-12-14)

With the 2.0.0 release we now declare the v2 systems "out of preview".

## v2-preview (2016-08-21)

The v2-preview is a rewrite of almost all backend code, following a clear separation of concerns between components. Instead of using hard to read EUIs for applications and devices, you can now work with IDs that you can choose yourself. We added many new features and are sure that you'll love them.

## v1-staging (2016-04-18)

With the "staging" release we introduced device management, downlink messages, over the air activation, message encryption and MQTT feeds for receiving messages.

The day before the official launch of The Things Network, we sent our first text with an application built on The Things Network.
