// It listens to request of the form: [PUT] /end-devices/:devEUI

//
// It also looks for params:
//
// - app_eui (8 bytes hex-encoded string)
// - app_url (http address as string)
// - nwks_key (16 bytes hex-encoded string)
//
// It fails with an http 400 Bad Request. if one of the parameter is missing or invalid
// It succeeds with an http 2xx if the request is valid (the response status is under the
// ackNacker responsibility.
// It can possibly fails with another status depending of the AckNacker response.
