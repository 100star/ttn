The Things Network is a global open crowdsourced Internet of Things data network.

## Status

This repository **will become** version 1.0 of The Things Network. It is **under heavy development** and currently it's APIs and code are not yet stable (pre 1.0).

To get started with LoRaWAN and The Things Network, you can also have a look at a *demonstration version* of the network, which is documented on the [wiki](http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/). Development of the demonstration version is done in the [croft](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/croft) and [jolie](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/jolie) repositories. The demonstration version will soon be deprecated, but a compatible application will be built on top of the new infrastructure that is being built in this repository.
